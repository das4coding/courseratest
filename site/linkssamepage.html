	<h3>Section 1 || Values</h3>
	<p>Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more.</p>
	<p>To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values. Though all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on.</p>
	<p>
		To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is convenient. You don’t have to gather building material for your values or pay for them. You just call for one, and whoosh, you have it. They are not really created from thin air, of course. Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of memory. Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.
	</p>
	<p>This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs, that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values.</p>

	<h3>Section 2 || Numbers</h3>
	<p>Values of the number type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript program, they are written as follows: 13
	</p>
	<p>Use that in a program, and it will cause the bit pattern for the number 13 to come into existence inside the computer’s memory.</p>
	<p>JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number value. There are only so many patterns you can make with 64 bits, which means that the number of different numbers that can be represented is limited. With N decimal digits, you can represent 10N numbers. Similarly, given 64 binary digits, you can represent 264 different numbers, which is about 18 quintillion (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That’s a lot.</p>
	<p>Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally overflow such small numbers—to end up with a number that did not fit into the given number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.</p>

	<h3>Section 3 || Arithmetic</h3>
	<p>
		The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript: 10*14+10
	</p>
	<p>The + and * symbols are called operators. The first stands for addition, and the second stands for multiplication. Putting an operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce a new value.</p>

<section id="section4">
	<h3>Section 4 || Special numbers</h3>
	<p>There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal numbers.</p>
	<p>The first two are Infinity and -Infinity, which represent the positive and negative infinities. Infinity - 1 is still Infinity, and so on. Don’t put too much trust in infinity-based computation, though. It isn’t mathematically sound, and it will quickly lead to the next special number: NaN.
	</p>
	<p>NaN stands for “not a number”, even though it is a value of the number type. You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate 0 / 0 (zero divided by zero), Infinity - Infinity, or any number of other numeric operations that don’t yield a meaningful result.</p>

	<h3>Section 5 || Strings</h3>
	<p>The next basic data type is the string. Strings are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes.
	</p>
		<p>'Down on the sea'</p>	
		<br>"Lie on the ocean"
		<br>'Float on the ocean'
	</section>

	<h3>Section 6 || Boolean values</h3>
	<p>It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two possibilities, like “yes” and “no” or “on” and “off”. For this purpose, JavaScript has a Boolean type, which has just two values, true and false, which are written as those words.</p>
